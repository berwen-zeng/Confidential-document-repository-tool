# Confidential-document-repository-tool
This work designs and implements a confidential file repository tool that enables users to store and browse files encrypted through a graphical user interface (GUI). Legitimate users can add, delete, browse and view file contents, while illegal users can only browse the file list and will see deceptive content when viewing file contents.
